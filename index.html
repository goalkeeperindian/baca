          <div class="main-p">
            <p>13 years into his position as creative director of Balmain, Oliver Rousteing has created some of
              the biggest moments in fashion pop culture. For this collection, the House of Balmain was
              inspired by some of Monsieur Balmain’s strongest designs from the sixties and seventies.
              The designs are a conversation along two main lines. The first a rousing recollection of
              Rousteing’s own history with the brand; the second - that of Pierre Balmain, its’ founder.
  
              <br> <br>With calls to the sixties and seventies, the collections sees sculptural menswear and
              lavishly
              decorated womenswear along with the platforms and flares most notorious of the decade, and the
              time in which the house founder began to wind down his designed output.

          <p class="details-p">Another motif of the House's essential design code, Pierre Balmain’s chic and
            enduring 1970s silk-scarf silhouettes were the
            inspiration for these designs. Printed silk scarves from the ‘70s became draped tops, loose tunics
            and wrap skirts. Many of those silk
            offerings were covered with variations on the house’s timeless graphic patterns.<br><br>Womenswear
